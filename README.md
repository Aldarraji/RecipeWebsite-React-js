# RecipeWebsite-React-js
### Search a recipe for any type of ingredient. This website uses EDAMAM.com API to make GET request.
Note: Need to have a react project created first then just replace the folders: public and src with the ones in the repositorie.  
Also the Website is limit to 1 search every 10 minutes.
